# Stakehouse
Stakehouse is an application aimed at lowering the technical bar to staking on Ethereum 2.0.


Dubbed a 'one-click installer', it provides a clean UI automating the setup and management of all the infrastructure necessary to stake without the user needing to have any technical knowledge.

## Disclaimer
Stakehouse:
 - only runs on Ubuntu (see below for more system requirements)
 - is currently experimental - use at your own risk
 - only runs on pyrmont (right now)
 - does not currently do anything with real ETH or mainnet (__DO NOT USE REAL ETH__)

## Usage
There are no releases yet.  Please see Development section.

## Development
### Requirements
 - Ubuntu 20.04
 - 16GB RAM
 - SSD with 200GB free
 - root access

### Setup
Stakehouse is a React app running in Electron and currently *only runs on Ubuntu* (tested on version 20.04).  See `src/electron/` for the simple electron app and `src/react/` for where the magic happens.  Feedback and help is much encouraged so please reach out!

 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn run build:watch` in one terminal - this continually watches and builds your ts code and puts it in `./dist`
 - `yarn start` in another terminal - this runs your app (the code in `./dist`)

_If you make changes, save them and they will automatically build.  In order to get them to show in the app press `ctrl+r` or `cmd+r`_
