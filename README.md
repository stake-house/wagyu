Wagyu (formerly known as StakeHouse) is an application aimed at lowering the technical bar to staking on Ethereum 2.0.


Dubbed a 'one-click installer', it provides a clean UI automating the setup and management of all the infrastructure necessary to stake without the user needing to have any technical knowledge.

## Disclaimer
Wagyu:
 - only runs on Ubuntu (see below for more system requirements)
 - is not audited - use at your own risk
 - is currently experimental and still under development
 - only runs on pyrmont (right now)
 - does not currently do anything with real ETH or mainnet (__DO NOT USE REAL ETH__)

## Demo
Wagyu (while it was known as StakeHouse) did a demo at the EthStaker Validator Workshop - take a look [here](https://youtu.be/cxP9gwapXJ0).

## Staking Resources
We are going to assume if you've gotten this far you already know about Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0, if not we suggest starting with [Superphiz's overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkpW031RCI) then heading over to [the EthStaker reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/jjdxvw/welcome_to_rethstaker_the_home_for_ethereum/) and [checking out our Studymaster program](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/wiki/studymaster). 

The key to the Eth2 upgrades is the introduction of staking and the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. This transition, referred to as "The Merge", will make Ethereum more secure and sustainable while unlocking what is needed to achieve scalability through sharding. By becoming an Ethereum validator and staking your Ethereum you can do a public good, securing the network, while earning rewards.

## Usage
There are no releases yet, please see the [setup](#setup) section under development to run the latest version.

## Getting Involved
Theres plenty left to do with Wagyu.  If you'd like to help out come join us on the [EthStaker](http://invite.gg/ethstaker) discord, channel #stakehouse, or reach out to Colfax (discord username: colfax#1983) directly.


Also try it out (feedback welcome!), take a look our demo above, and/or browse our open [issues](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu/issues) (start by filtering by the label 'small').

## Development
### Requirements
 - Ubuntu 20.04
 - 16GB RAM
 - SSD with 200GB free
 - root access

### Setup
Wagyu is a React app running in Electron and currently *only runs on Ubuntu* (tested on version 20.04).  See `src/electron/` for the simple electron app and `src/react/` for where the magic happens.  Feedback and help is much encouraged so please reach out!

Start by cloning this repo and enter the directory by running `git clone https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu.git` and `cd wagyu`.  Then run the following:
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn build` (or run `yarn run build:watch` in a separate terminal to hot reload your changes)
   - _If you are running with `build:watch` after saving your changes will automatically build.  In order to get them to show in the app press `ctrl+r` or `cmd+r`._
 - `yarn start`

### Installing Yarn on Ubuntu
Run the following commands:

1) `sudo apt update`
2) `sudo apt remove cmdtest yarn`
3) `sudo apt install npm`
4) `sudo npm install -g yarn`  

### Contribution Guidelines
To streamline contributions to React code within the Wagyu codebase, a small set of guidelines encapsulating our opinions is included here: 
1) Libraries - Use `styled-components` for css encapsulation, `rem` units for any pixel sizes (potentially via the utility library `polished`).
2) Typescript - Make generous use of everything typescript has to offer (don't use `any`... ever).
3) Formatting - This codebase uses `prettier` (rules defined in `.prettierrc`) for standardized code formatting. If using vscode, the formatter will run on save, if not, be sure to run `npx prettier --write "**/*.ts*"` to format the code.
4) Common components - Extract commonly used typography or UI elements into the `typography` directory.
5) Utility Functions - Keep utility functions that don't deal with rendering outside of components.
6) Other Opinions - Refrain from using 'render' functions within functional components. Extract this logic out into a separate component instead. Refrain from using `<br />` and use padding and/or margin instead.
